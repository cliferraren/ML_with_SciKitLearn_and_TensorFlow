Here, we learned Machine learning which is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed.

> Linear Regression is a fundamental algorithm in machine learning
> It is used as a building block for other ML models.
> LR is fast and easy to understand, calculate, and interpret.
> Often good enough. Don't over-engineer your solution. If your data is linear then use a linear model.
